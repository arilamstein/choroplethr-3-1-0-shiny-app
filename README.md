# choroplethr-3-1-0-shiny-app
A web application to demonstrate the demographic datasets that ship with [choroplethr v3.1.0](https://justanrblog.wordpress.com/choroplethr-v3-1-0-better-summary-demographic-data).

You can view the running application [here](https://arilamstein.shinyapps.io/choroplethr-3-1-0-shiny-app/). If you see an 
error message that means that I have exausted my monthly quota at my hosting service. In that case you can install the application 
yourself by typing the following from an [R](https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog) console:

# install.packages("shiny")
library(shiny)
shiny::runGitHub("choroplethr-3-1-0-shiny-app", "arilamstein")
